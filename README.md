# RubiksCube
You just need to copy the three classes also in this repository and the code should automatically work.

Running Cube.java will prompt a scramble. It can be given in a number of formats, it just requires letters [RUFDBL] to denote the different faces of the cube, and up to one modifier for each [\'2] denoting a counterclockwise and 180 degree turn, respectively. It can take spaces or nothing as delimiters, and can be in upper or lower case. 

This scramble will be performed as if the white face is on top and green is in front.

Then, using the beginner's method, it will solve the cube and output the solution.
